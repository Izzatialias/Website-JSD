				<p>Assalamualaikum and greetings,</p>
				<p>
				Today, we are in the midst of a rapid revolution of data science. Data science (DS) is transforming the way we solve engineering, science, and societal problems. 
				With the advent of technology in various fields has made it possible to capture, process and analyse data from multiple medias. 
				Furthermore, in the internet of things (IoT) era, it has provided us good infrastructure and utilities of DS for various domain applications.
				</p><p>
				Innovations in DS have changed the way we communicate and businesses operate.
				Many of recent AI algorithms, methods and computational designs are data driven. 
				While many learning world-leading institutions have strategised various initiatives to realise the potential of DS, the relevance of our establishment is to serve the increasing demand of well-educated data scientists for the country.
				For that, first of all, we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone on your blessings, thrusts and efforts given for the establishment of Department Data Science (known as JSD, Jabatan Sains Data in Malay). 
				We embrace the opportunity and challenges to develop a world-class institution of data science and seek to make an impact on a regional, national and global levels.
				</p><p>
				JSD is founded in Jan 2021. We started off as a research centre of excellence namely Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (AIBIG) at Universiti Malaysia Kelantan. 
				Then, JSD has been established to offer and run it academic programmes related to Data Science. The department is devoted to academic excellence and strive towards becoming the Faculty of Data Science. 
				</p><p>
				The Department is committed to facilitating high quality education, research and industrial collaboration in Data Science and related fields to meet the dynamics of global transformation. 
				Currently, it offers two programmes: Bachelor of Information Technology (Tracks in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science) and Ph.D in Computing focusing on the research areas in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and IOT. Bachelor of Information Technology is designed with emphasis of industry based curriculum including Huawei, Microsoft and Alibaba.
				Teaching and learning will be based on educational modules from these companies in which upon completing those courses, students are eligible to have professional certification by passing particular examination. 
				Moreover, the program also offers Digital Entrepreneurship course incorporating the modules from Alibaba, in supporting the grooming of digital entrepreneurship talents for the country. 
				The program is accredited by Malaysia Board of Technologist (MBOT) that provides competitive advantages to our students. With similar emphasis, the scope of research for Ph.D programme is also tailored to solving the real world industry problems. 
				Multiple industrial collaboration research projects are aimed to build the academia-industry ecosystem. The next immediate programme in the pipeline is Master of Science in Computing (Research Mode) which we anticipate to offer latest by September 2021.
				</p><p>
				Despite the role as an education provider, we are also committed to quality and excellence in research, engaging in both fundamental and applied research that focus on real world problems or issues.
				We emphasise on creating new knowledge and innovative products that make impact to the society, academia, government, industry and environment. 
				Our research focus areas are on Data Analytics, Data Architecture, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Optimisation and Internet of Things. 
				As supports to the main streams, we also have expertise in Advanced Communications, Mechatronics, Solar Technology and Neuroinformatics. 
				</p><p>
				I look forward to welcoming you to JSD for education, partnership, and research collaborations in realising the potential of data science.

				Best wishes
